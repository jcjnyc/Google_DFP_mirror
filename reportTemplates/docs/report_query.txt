statement   Statement  Specifies a filter to use for reporting on data. This filter will be used in conjunction (joined with an AND statement) with the date range selected through dateRangeType, startDate, and endDate and the dimension filters selected through dimensionFilters. The syntax currently allowed for Statement.query is
[WHERE <condition> {AND <condition> ...}] 
<condition>
     := <property> = <value> 
<condition> 
     := <property> = <bind variable> 
<condition> := <property> IN <list> 
<bind variable> := :<name> 
where property is the enumeration name of a Dimension that can be filtered.

For example, the statement "WHERE LINE_ITEM_ID IN (34344, 23235)" can be used to generate a report for a specific set of line items

Filtering on IDs is highly recommended over filtering on names, especially for geographical entities. When filtering on names, matching is case sensitive.

timeZone  xsd:string	   The time zone in the form of America/New_York which the startDate and endDate are in, and the reporting information is gathered in. Defaults to Network.timeZone if it is null. All supported time zones can be found in the Time_Zone PQL table with SupportedInReports being true. Only time zones that are full hour offsets from Network.timeZone are supported.
